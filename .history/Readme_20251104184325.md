# Mujoco Pick and Place
This repository contains a MuJoCo-based pick-and-place simulation built around the FR3 robot model and several environment assets (table, bowl, meshes). The core simulation entry point is `MujocoSim.py`. There is also an interactive notebook, `project.ipynb`, with experiments and notes.
## Highlights
- MuJoCo-based robot simulation (FR3-derived robot model)
- Assets and XML models for table, bowl, and robot in the `assets/` folder
- Example notebook (`project.ipynb`) for exploring and running experiments
## Repository layout
- `MujocoSim.py` - main Python script to run the MuJoCo simulation
- `project.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with instructions, experiments, and demos
- `Readme.md` - this file
- `assets/` - XML, URDF, and mesh files used by the simulation
	- `bowl/` - scanned-object model adapted for MuJoCo
	- `fr3_*.xml`, `fr3.urdf` - robot assets and configurations
	- `meshes/` - mesh and material files
## Prerequisites
1. MuJoCo installed on your machine (MuJoCo 2.x recommended). Follow MuJoCo's installation instructions and make sure your MuJoCo license/key is available if required.
2. Python 3.8+ (3.10 or newer recommended).
3. Python bindings for MuJoCo. Depending on your setup either:
	 - `mujoco` (the official Python package for newer MuJoCo releases), or
	 - `mujoco-py` (older bindings; if you prefer this, ensure it is compatible with your MuJoCo version).
Common Python packages typically used with this repo: `numpy`, `imageio`, `glfw` (or other windowing bindings), and whichever MuJoCo Python package you choose.
Note: This repository does not include MuJoCo binaries or license keys.
## Quick start
1. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
2. Install dependencies. If there is a `requirements.txt` add it and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If no `requirements.txt` is present, install packages manually, for example:
```bash
pip install numpy imageio glfw
# and install the MuJoCo python bindings you prefer, e.g.:
pip install mujoco
```
3. Ensure MuJoCo is installed and the environment variables required by your binding are set. For example, with some setups you may need to set `MUJOCO_PY_MUJOCO_PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to point to your MuJoCo installation.
4. Run the simulation script:
```bash
python3 MujocoSim.py
```
5. Open `project.ipynb` in JupyterLab/Notebook for interactive experiments and visualizations.
## Assets and models
All the scene and robot assets live under the `assets/` folder. Notable files/folders:
- `fr3_assets.xml`, `fr3_default.xml`, `fr3_motors.xml` - robot configuration files
- `fr3_on_table.xml`, `fr3_on_table_body.xml` - prebuilt scenes with the robot on a table
- `bowl/` - scanned-object bowl model adapted from an external resource
- `meshes/` - visual and collision meshes used by the XML files
If you add or modify models, keep mesh paths consistent and verify the XML references are correct.
## Notes & troubleshooting
- If the simulation fails to start, check that MuJoCo and your Python MuJoCo bindings are correctly installed and that any required environment variables (e.g., library paths or license keys) are set.
- If you see missing mesh/material errors, verify the `meshes/` subfolders and file paths under `assets/`.
- For headless operation (no GUI), check your MuJoCo binding for offscreen rendering options.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Good first steps are:
1. Add a `requirements.txt` listing Python dependencies.
2. Add usage examples in the notebook or add small demo scripts.
3. Add a license file if you want to share this repository publicly under a specific license.
When submitting changes, please ensure XML asset paths remain valid and meshes are included or documented.
## License
This repository does not include an explicit license. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to publish under a permissive or restrictive license.

If you'd like, I can also: (1) create a `requirements.txt` with likely dependencies, (2) add a small run script for launching the notebook, or (3) add a LICENSE file — tell me which and I'll add it.
